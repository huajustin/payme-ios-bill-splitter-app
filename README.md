# payme-ios-bill-splitter-app
An independent hackathon project to build an iOS bill splitting app that allows users to keep track of outstanding bills with the amount that's still remaining and people yet to pay

## Motivation
I wanted to get my hands dirty with some mobile/iOS development and drew inspiration from needing to be able to keep track of Ultimate frisbee players who had yet
to pay their team fees. This was the end result, capturing the basic use cases and allows me to better find out who still owes me money.
